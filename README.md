![temperature](https://github.com/sanjanavermaa/CODTECH-Task2/assets/166320207/2408520d-f856-4a1f-8ad7-bba2fb09fcb2)

Objective:
Develop a temperature conversion program in C that allows users to input temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin, and converts them seamlessly between all three units based on user-selected conversions.

key activities:
 Implementing functions in C to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin using established conversion formulas, ensuring robust input handling and clear output formatting, thus facilitating accurate and user-friendly temperature conversions in a single program interface.

Technology used:
The project utilizes C programming language for its efficiency and direct hardware access, ensuring optimal performance in temperature calculations. Input/output operations are managed using standard libraries like <stdio.h>, enabling seamless user interaction and precise temperature conversions between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.
